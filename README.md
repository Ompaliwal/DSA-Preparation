### Description for GitHub DSA Preparation Code

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation code** in C++. It is designed to help learners, students, and job seekers build strong DSA fundamentals by providing well-commented solutions to common problems frequently asked in coding interviews, technical assessments, and programming competitions.

**Features:**
- **Well-Structured Code:** Clean, organized C++ code for each DSA problem, focusing on readability and best practices.
- **Topic Coverage:** Includes core topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, recursion, and more.
- **Problem Statements:** Each file contains a clear problem description so you can understand the objective before diving into the code.
- **Step-by-Step Comments:** Every solution is thoroughly documented with inline comments explaining the logic and approach.
- **Edge Cases Included:** Handles special scenarios such as zero, negative numbers, and large input values wherever applicable.
- **Practical Printing Techniques:** Uses effective output and debugging strategies relevant for C++ learners.
- **Modern C++ Practices:** Emphasizes code that is both efficient and adheres to current C++ standards.
- **Easy to Customize:** Ideal for quick revision or forking—add your own solutions or try variations for deeper learning.
